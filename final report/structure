Experimental Setup:

    - Zenbo
        => picture of Zenbo! :D  TODO
        => what is Zenbo?
        => What can Zenbo do?
    - Zenbo functionality
        => how does it work?
    Implementation Details
        => general what language did we use?
        1. Navigation
            => how to scan the room?
                -> Zenbo SDK provides a functionality in order to scan the room and map the coords
                -> 
            => how to navigate through the room?/moving Zenbos head?
                -> The robot provides a function called goTo, which can be utilized in order to move through the room
                -> We also used one function called moveHead in order to move the robots head either to the left or the the right
            => how to search for persons? (Diagram Juila)
                -> depths first search
                -> seeking DFA
                -> 
        2. Computer Vision
            => how to access the camera?
                - Zenbo SDK does not provide direct access to the camera
            => how to detect a person?
                - Zenbo SDK built in functions:
                - Callback result: TODO 
            => approch to find persons?
                - for every detected person store their id
                - seeker gets a id in case he asks zenbo to play with him
                - in case we see a person we request the person to tuern around
                - if that id matches the hider perfekt => we found him
        3. Language Processing
            => how to do with ZenboSDK?
                - onEventUserUtterance callback with speech recognition => returns a JSON Object containing the understood sentences
            => how to react respond towards user input?
                - we handeled different senctces with different states
                - what happened if zenbo did not undertstand the user?
        4. User Interaction
                => how to say sth to the user?
                => other ways of expressing emotions?
                => set face state?
Results:
    - Features we couldn't include because they wheren technically provided:
        => 
    - Difficulties with Zenbo

        => Room mapping needs admin password
            -> GFRP problem
        => NLP did not provide proper speech rcognition
        => CV modulke returned somtimes -15 for some reasons
        => we couldn't create some features, because asus claims to have them but did not provide us:
            - ...


    - Improvements on Zenbo SDK
        => Implementation: provide missing features
        => Implementation: improve NLP/CV model or let the user use their own (Firebase, ... provides quite good and easy to use models)
        => Implementation: work on a better and fully available documentation of the ZenboSDK
        => Documentation: instead of providing 10 Monster projects create small how-to sections on some topics (Like the do it with Vue.js)

Conclusion:
    => important role of smart mobile robots for endusers
    => endusers are able to write their own programs 
    => as well as companys who can provide software for the endusers
    => hide and seek as a challenging task for a robot with various different applications
    =>
